# Exercises for Practices of the Python Pro üêçüìò

This repository contains the source code for the examples and exercises contained in [Practices of the Python Pro](https://bit.ly/the-python-pro).
The repository is a template repository, so if you'd like to follow along with the book you can [make your own copy](https://github.com/daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro/generate).

Each chapter's examples are in their own directory.
In some chapters, you'll find multiple snippets in a single module.
These won't always produce output when you run them, and are occasionally meant only as snippets to demonstrate a concept.
In later chapters, some modules act as an entrypoint to run a program from the command line, importing other modules along the way.
Follow along in the book for more context!
